# Slovensk√© meniny / Slovak Name Days

## About
This repository provides a comprehensive, official collection of name days listed in the Slovak calendar, presented in multiple computer-readable formats.

## Big Picture
A name day in Slovakia refers to the tradition of celebrating individual names on specific days throughout the year. Each day is associated with one or more names, and people who have that name celebrate their name day on that date. It is a cultural tradition where people often offer congratulations, small gifts, or good wishes to those celebrating their name day.

The official calendar was prepared by the Calendar Commission, which is composed of representatives from the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of the Interior, three publishers, and linguists.

The main criteria for choosing names included compliance with the literary norms of the Slovak language, historical presence in both local and European traditions, and the frequency of the name within the population.

The official calendar was approved, upon the proposal of the Calendar Commission, by the Minister of Culture in June 2017. The calendar is typically reconsidered once a year.

## FAQ
**Q: Why do some dates, e.g., 1st of Jan, 1st of May, 25th of Dec, not have assigned names?**

**A:** These dates are reserved for special events or public holidays and therefore do not have specific names assigned to them.

**Q: How often do you revise this repository?**

**A:** We expect that the next meeting of the Calendar Commission, where the calendar will be reconsidered, will take place in June 2025.
