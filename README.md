# Slovensk√© meniny / Slovak name days


## About
This repository provides a comprehensive official collection of name days listed in the Slovak calendar, presented in multiple computer-readable formats.


## Big picture
Name day in Slovakia refers to the tradition of celebrating individual names on specific days throughout the year. Each day of the year is associated with one or more names, and those who bear the respective name celebrate their name day on that particular date. It's a cultural tradition where people often offer congratulations, small gifts, or good wishes to those celebrating their name day.

Official Calendar was prepared by the Calendar Commission composed of representatives from the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of the Interior, three publishers, and linguists.

The primary criteria for choosing names included: compliance with the literary norm of the Slovak language, history in both local and European traditions, and the occurrence of the name within the population.

The Official Calendar was approved upon the proposal of the Calendar Commission by the Minister of Culture in June 2017. The calendar is typically reconsidered once a year.

## FAQ
**Q: Why some dates, e.g., 1st of Jan, 1st of May, 25th of Dec, do not have assigned names?** 

**A:** These dates are reserved for special events or public holidays and therefore do not have specific names assigned to these days.

**Q: How often do you revise this repository?**

**A:** We expect that the next meeting of the Calendar Commission, where the calendar will be reconsidered, to take place in June 2024.
